\begin{document}
Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a probability space and $T:X\rightarrow X$ a measure preserving transformation. Let $f$ be a $L^1(\mu)$ function.
Define the averages 
$$f^*(x)=\sup_{N\geq 1} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(T^i(x))$$
Then, for any $\lambda \in \textbf{R}$, we have:
$$\int_{f^*>\lambda} fd\mu \geq \lambda \mu ( \{f^* > \lambda \} )$$
This theorem may be used in the proof of the ergodic theorem (also known as Birkhoff ergodic theorem, or pointwise or strong ergodic theorem)
