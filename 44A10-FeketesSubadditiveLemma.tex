\begin{document}
Let $(a_n)_n$ be a subadditive sequence in $[-\infty,\infty)$. Then, the following limit exists in $[-\infty,\infty)$ and equals the infimum of the same sequence:
$$\lim_{n} \frac{a_n}{n}= \inf_n \frac{a_n}{n}$$
Although the lemma is usually stated for subadditive sequences, an analogue conclusion is valid for superadditive sequences. In that case, for $(a_n)_n$ a subadditive sequence in $(-\infty,\infty]$, one has:
$$\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n}=\sup_n \frac{a_n}{n}$$
The proof of the superadditive case is obtained by taking the symmetric sequence $(-a_n)_n$ and applying the subadditive version of the theorem.
