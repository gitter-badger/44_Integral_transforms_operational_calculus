The \emph{Mellin transform} is an integral transform defined as follows:
\[
 F(s) = \int_0^\infty f(t) t^{s-1} \, dt
\]
Intuitively, it may be viewed as a continuous analogue of a power series 
--- instead of synthetizing a function by summing multiples of integer
powers, we integrate over all real powers.  This transform is closely
related to the Laplace transform --- if we make a change of variables
$t = e^{-r}$  and define $g$ by $f(e^{-r}) = g(r)$, then the above integral 
becomes
\[
 F(s) = -\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(r) e^{-rs} \, dr ,
\]
which is a bilateral Laplace transform.
