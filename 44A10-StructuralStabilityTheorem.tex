\begin{document}
Let $M$ be a compact differentiable manifold and let $f:M\rightarrow M$ be a $C^r$ diffeomorphism.

Then, $f$ is structurally stable in the $C^1$ topology if and only if it is Axiom A and satisfies the strong transversality condition.
The question of knowing if this is valid for the $C^r$ topology, $r\geq 2$ is still open.
