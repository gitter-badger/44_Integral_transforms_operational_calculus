Let $(M,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a probability space, and $f:M\rightarrow M$ be a measure preserving dynamical system. let $\phi_n:M\rightarrow \textbf{R}$, $n\geq 1$ be a subadditive sequence of measurable functions, such that $\phi_1^+$ is integrable, where $\phi_1^+=\max \{\phi,0\}$. Then, the sequence $(\frac{\phi_n}{n})_n$ converges $\mu$ almost everywhere to a function $\phi: M \rightarrow [-\infty,\infty)$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] $\phi^+$ is integrable
\item[] $\phi$ is $f$ invariant, that is, $\phi(f(x))=\phi(x)$ for $\mu$ almost all $x$, and
\item[] $$\int \phi d\mu = \lim_n \frac{1}{n} \int \phi_n d\mu= \inf_n \frac{1}{n} \int \phi_n d\mu \in [-\infty,\infty)$$
\end{itemize}
The fact that the limit equals the infimum is a consequence of the fact that the sequence $\int \phi_n d\mu$ is a subadditive sequence and Fekete's subadditive lemma. 

A superadditive version of the theorem also exists. Given a superadditive sequence $\varphi_n$, then the symmetric sequence is subadditive and we may apply the original version of the theorem.

Every additive sequence is subadditive. As a consequence, one can prove the Birkhoff ergodic theorem from Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem.
