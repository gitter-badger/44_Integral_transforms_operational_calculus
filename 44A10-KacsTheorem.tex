\begin{document}
Let $f:M\rightarrow M$ be a transformation and $\mu$ a finite invariant measure for $f$. Let $E$ be a subset of $M$ with positive measure. We define the first return map for $E$:
$$\rho_E(x)=\min \{ n \geq 1: f^n(x)\in E \}$$
If the set on the right is empty, then we define $\rho_E(x)=\infty$. The Poincaré recurrence theorem asserts that $\rho_E$ is finite for almost every $x \in R$.
We define the following sets:
$$E_0 = \{ x \in E: f^n(x) \notin E, n\geq 1 \}$$
$$E_0^*= \{ x \in M: f^n(x) \notin E, n \geq 0 \}$$
By Poincaré recurrence theorem, $\mu(E_0)=0$.
Kac's theorem asserts that the function $\rho_E$ is integrable and
$$\int_E \rho_E d\mu= \mu(M)-\mu(E_0^*)$$
When the system is ergodic, then $\mu(E_0^*)=0$, and Kac's theorem implies:
$$\frac{1}{\mu(E)}\int_E \rho_E d\mu = \frac{\mu(M)}{\mu(E)}$$
This equality can be interpreted as: the mean return time to $E$ s inversely proportional to the measure of $E$.
