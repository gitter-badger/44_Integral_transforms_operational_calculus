If there is a $m$ such that $a_m=-\infty$, then, by subadditivity, we have $a_n=-\infty$ for all $n>m$. Then, both sides of the equality are $-\infty$, and the theorem holds.
So, we suppose that $a_n \in \textbf{R}$ for all $n$. Let $L=\inf_n \frac{a_n}{n}$ and let $B$ be any number greater than $L$. Choose $k\geq 1$ such that 
$$\frac{a_k}{k}<B$$
For $n>k$, we have, by the division algorithm there are integers $p_n$ and $q_n$ such that $n=p_nk+q_n$, and $0\leq q_n \leq k-1$.
Applying the definition of subadditivity many times we obtain:
$$a_n=a_{p_nk+q_n}\leq a_{p_nk}+a_{q_n} \leq p_na_k+a_{q_n}$$
So, dividing by $n$ we obtain:
$$ \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{p_nk}{n} \frac{a_k}{k}+\frac{a_{q_n}}{n}$$
When $n$ goes to infinity, $\frac{p_nk}{n}$ converges to $1$ and $\frac{a_{q_n}}{n}$ converges to zero, because the numerator is bounded by the maximum of $a_i$ with $0\leq i \leq k-1$. So, we have, for all $B>L$:
$$L\leq \lim_n \frac{a_n}{n} \leq \frac{a_k}{k} < B$$
Finally, let $B$ go to $L$ and we obtain
$$L=\inf_n \frac{a_n}{n}=\lim_n \frac{a_n}{n}$$
